# Log for branch 250610 - File 001

## Task Initiation: Restructure and Relocate RPi Docker Setup

User request: "Create a new branch 250610 and a folder rpi_docker to contain the files that need to be pushed to the repo. Start new (logs)."

This log file tracks activities on branch `250610`.

## Branch Creation and File Restructuring

1.  **Created New Branch:**
    *   Created branch `250610` from the latest state of branch `250607`.
    *   Switched to branch `250610`.

2.  **File Restructuring:**
    *   Created new directory `rpi_docker/` at the repository root.
    *   Moved `250607/Dockerfile` to `rpi_docker/Dockerfile`.
    *   Moved `250607/README.md` to `rpi_docker/README.md`.
    *   Removed the old `250607/` directory and its contents (including `.gitkeep`).
    *   All these changes were staged.

3.  **Updated Paths in Documentation:**
    *   Modified `rpi_docker/README.md` to update all references from `250607/` to `rpi_docker/`. This primarily affected Docker build command examples and descriptions of file locations.
