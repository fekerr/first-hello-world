# Log for branch 250611 - File 001

## Task Initiation: Archive Full Session Logs

User request: "Create branch 250611 and folder 250611. Save all logs related to this session that may not have saved or verified committed to the repo, to 250611/250611.md and 250611/* just to capture all logging, the sequence of prompt and response, work done, issues such as publish apparently not working, etc. as this is purely additive, create new files without friction. Try not to block on waiting for me."

This log file tracks activities on branch `250611`.

## Session Log Archival Process

1.  **Created New Branch and Directories:**
    *   Created branch `250611` from the latest state of branch `250610`.
    *   Switched to branch `250611`.
    *   Created directory `250611/` at the repository root.
    *   Created subdirectory `250611/archived_Jules_logs/`.
    *   Added `.gitkeep` files to these directories and staged them.

2.  **Consolidated Session Log:**
    *   Read the contents of `Jules/250607_001.md`, `Jules/250607_002.md`, and `Jules/250610_001.md`.
    *   Prepended a new "Session Overview" section summarizing the entire session's activities, including tasks on branches `250607` and `250610`, and explicitly mentioning issues like remote push problems and log corruption incidents.
    *   Wrote the combined content to `250611/250611.md`.

3.  **Archived Original Log Files:**
    *   Copied `Jules/250607_001.md` to `250611/archived_Jules_logs/250607_001.md`.
    *   Copied `Jules/250607_002.md` to `250611/archived_Jules_logs/250607_002.md`.
    *   Copied `Jules/250610_001.md` to `250611/archived_Jules_logs/250610_001.md`.
    *   Staged these newly copied files.

4.  **Current Step:** Created this log file, `Jules/250611_001.md`, to document actions on branch `250611`.
