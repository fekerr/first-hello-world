Here is a summary log of the session.

### Session Summary Log

**Objective:** Troubleshoot, refine, and document a workflow for a Docker-based Raspberry Pi (ARMv7) emulation environment.

---

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & Environment Troubleshooting

* **Prompt 1:** User provided a `README.md` for an emulated RPi project and asked if they should "work this through Jules."
* **Response 1:** Assumed "Jules" referred to Canonical's IoT platform and described how it could be used for fleet management after local development.

* **Prompt 2:** User clarified "Jules" is an internal Google tool (`jules.google.com`).
* **Response 2:** Acknowledged the clarification, hypothesized the tool's function as an AI coding assistant, and described how it could be used to automate improvements to the Dockerfile and workflow.

* **Prompt 3:** User stated a need to work through the setup manually and provided the first error: `sh: 0: cannot open docker: No such file`. User correctly inferred Docker was not installed.
* **Response 3:** Confirmed the user's diagnosis. Explained the error was compounded by an incorrect `sh` prefix. Provided step-by-step instructions to install Docker Desktop and then proceed with the documented commands.

* **Prompt 4:** User correctly noted that `docker` is a command on its own and found the `sh` prefix in the `README.md` confusing.
* **Response 4:** Validated the user's point and explained that ` ```sh ` in Markdown is for syntax highlighting, not part of the command itself.

* **Prompt 5:** User noted their terminal tool `batcat` was not rendering the `README.md` file correctly, showing raw Markdown source.
* **Response 5:** Explained that `batcat` is a source code viewer, not a Markdown renderer. Recommended and provided instructions to install `glow` for terminal-based rendering.

* **Prompt 6:** User reported that `apt` could not find the `glow` package, but `snap` could.
* **Response 6:** Acknowledged the correction and provided the correct `sudo snap install glow` command, explaining the difference in package availability.

* **Prompt 7:** User asked if `glow` supports paging to avoid having content "spat out".
* **Response 7:** Confirmed `glow` uses a pager (`less`) by default and provided common navigation keys.

* **Prompt 8:** User reported that automatic paging was not working in their environment.
* **Response 8:** Diagnosed a terminal environment issue and provided the workaround of manually piping output to the pager: `glow README.md | less`.

* **Prompt 9:** User noted that `glow` was not rendering boxes around ` ``` ` code blocks.
* **Response 9:** Corrected the prompt's syntax (`'''` to ` ``` `).

* **Prompt 10:** User confirmed ` ``` ` block syntax and the issue.
* **Response 10:** Explained this was a styling issue. Provided the solution of using `glow -s dracula` and how to make the style permanent with the `GLOW_STYLE` environment variable.

* **Prompt 11:** User provided a screenshot showing raw ANSI escape codes in the output of `glow | less`, with the comment "yuck".
* **Response 11:** Diagnosed that `less` was not interpreting the color codes. Provided the fix of using the `-R` flag (`less -R`) and making it permanent with the `LESS` environment variable.

* **Prompt 12:** User reported that copy-pasting from the terminal output was breaking lines.
* **Response 12:** Explained the difference between visual and logical lines (line wrapping). Provided two solutions: using the `-S` flag in `less` for horizontal scrolling, and using `| clip.exe` to pipe output directly to the Windows clipboard.

### Phase 2: Container Internals & Debugging

* **Prompt 13:** User provided the output of the `docker run` command, including a platform mismatch warning.
* **Response 13:** Explained the warning was expected due to QEMU emulation and that the presence of a container ID indicated success. Provided `docker ps` to verify and instructions for the next step (SSH).

* **Prompt 14:** User provided the output of `docker ps`, confirming the container was running correctly.
* **Response 14:** Confirmed the output was correct and provided final SSH instructions, including how to handle the first-time host key verification.

* **Prompt 15:** User successfully SSH'd into the container but reported that `sudo apt update` and `su -` both failed with errors.
* **Response 15:** Diagnosed that `sudo` was non-functional and the `root` account was likely locked. Proposed a fix to the `Dockerfile` to explicitly set `sudo` permissions and unlock the `root` account. Provided a full cleanup and rebuild procedure.

* **Prompt 16:** User reported that after rebuilding, the `ssh` connection was refused.
* **Response 16:** Diagnosed that the container was likely exiting immediately on an error. Instructed the user to check with `docker ps -a` and `docker logs`.

* **Prompt 17:** User provided the `docker ps -a` output, showing the container had `Exited (255)`.
* **Response 17:** Confirmed this indicated a fatal startup error and requested the output of `docker logs` to get the specific error message.

* **Prompt 18:** User provided the log message: `Missing privilege separation directory: /run/sshd`.
* **Response 18:** Diagnosed the specific `sshd` startup error. Provided a new, revised `Dockerfile` that included `RUN mkdir -p /run/sshd` and instructed the user on the final rebuild process.

### Phase 3: Final Workflow & Automation Script

* **Prompt 19:** User confirmed their understanding of the Docker build context path.
* **Response 19:** Validated the user's understanding and provided a contrasting example to solidify the concept.

* **Prompt 20:** User stated a preference for working inside the project subdirectory (a monorepo pattern) and that it might involve shared files in the future.
* **Response 20:** Acknowledged this workflow and proactively explained the future "gotcha" with build context and shared files, providing the `-f` flag as the future solution.

* **Prompt 21:** User reported that after a final rebuild, they were able to SSH in, but `sudo` and `su` *still* failed with the exact same errors.
* **Response 21:** Concluded that the emulation environment itself was fundamentally preventing privilege escalation, making `Dockerfile` fixes impossible. Apologized for the failed attempts and proposed the definitive "two-terminal" workaround: using `ssh` for the `pi` user and `docker exec` for root access.

* **Prompt 22:** User accepted the workaround, asked for it to be documented, and requested a more factual tone.
* **Response 22:** Acknowledged the request and switched to a direct, factual tone.

* **Prompt 23:** User requested a wrapper script (`doit`) to automate the commands, with arguments for different actions, and asked whether to use Bash or Python.
* **Response 23:** Recommended Bash as the more direct tool for this task and provided a complete, self-contained `manage.sh` script with functions and argument parsing.

* **Prompt 24:** User requested the script be renamed to `doit` without the `.sh` extension.
* **Response 24:** Acknowledged the request as standard practice and provided the updated script with the name change reflected in the help text.

* **Prompt 25:** User requested a `status` command be added to the script to check on the environment.
* **Response 25:** Implemented a new `do_status` function that checks the Docker daemon, the project image, the container status, and the bind mount. Provided the updated script.

* **Prompt 26:** User requested improvements to the `ssh` function to handle the fingerprint prompt and to add a password reminder.
* **Response 26:** Modified the `do_ssh` function to use `ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` to bypass the interactive prompt and added an `echo` statement to display the password.

* **Prompt 27:** User requested combined/workflow commands, like `cleanrestart`.
* **Response 27:** Implemented state-checking functions and a new `do_cleanrestart` command that chains `cleanup`, `build`, `run`, and `ssh`.

* **Prompt 28:** User requested the entire final script for easy copying.
* **Response 28:** Provided the complete, final version of the `doit` script.

### Phase 4: Final Documentation

* **Prompt 29:** User requested updated documentation: a main `README.md` that refers to the script, and a separate `doit.md` with detailed script documentation.
* **Response 29:** Provided the content for both documentation files as requested.

* **Prompt 30:** User showed their directory structure with historical `Dockerfile` versions and asked which one to retain.
* **Response 30:** Advised the user to retain the final `Dockerfile` and remove the intermediate, non-functional versions.

* **Prompt 31:** User asked where the container's "disk" is located on the WSL2 filesystem.
* **Response 31:** Explained the Docker Desktop/WSL2 architecture, clarifying that the data resides in a separate `docker-desktop-data` WSL instance as a `ext4.vhdx` file on the Windows host, and is not directly browseable from the user's Ubuntu instance.

* **Prompt 32:** User asked how to map a folder for easy file sharing.
* **Response 32:** Explained the concept of a bind mount. Provided instructions to update the `doit` script's `run` command with the `-v` flag and a procedure to verify the shared folder works.

* **Prompt 33:** User noted the script should create the `shared` directory automatically and that the `status` command should check on it.
* **Response 33:** Updated the `doit` script's `run` function to include `mkdir -p shared` and updated the `status` function to report on the local directory and the container's mount point configuration.
