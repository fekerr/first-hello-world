I created ./rpi_docker with the help of jules.google.com some time ago.

It provides an emulated Raspberry Pi using a Docker container.

There is a ./doit bash script that provides a quick start and documents the commands to use the Docker container.

This is just a simple C version of hello world.
I am actually using it to build native and cross-compile on various targets such as RPi3b and PocketBeagle.

Updated repo back to public, stashing some "Jules.google.com" work.
